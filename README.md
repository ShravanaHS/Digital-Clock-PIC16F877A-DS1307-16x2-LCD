# Digital-Clock-PIC16F877A-DS1307-16x2-LCD
This project is a digital real-time clock built with the PIC16F877A microcontroller, utilizing the DS1307 RTC module for accurate timekeeping. The DS1307 communicates with the PIC via the I2C bus, providing a stable 1Hz clock signal and storing the current time and date in BCD format.
